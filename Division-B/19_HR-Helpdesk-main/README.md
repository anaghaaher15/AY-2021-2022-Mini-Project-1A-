# Introduction
The Human Resources department is a group who is responsible for managing the employee life 
cycle.
Ask any employee what an HR department is, and you’ll get an answer that primarily deals with 
the most uncomfortable aspects of work: HR violations, layoffs, and firing. But the truth is that 
human resources is there to support employees. It’s quite literally a resource for humans. 
The main tasks of a HR department are to recruit candidates, hire the right employees, process 
payroll, conduct disciplinary actions, update policies and maintain employee records.
# Scope 
The system generates types of information that can be used for various purposes. It 
satisfies the user requirement. It is easy to understand by the user and operator. It 
may help collecting perfect management in details. In a very short time, the usage will be 
obvious, simple and sensible. It will help a person to know the management of passed 
year perfectly and vividly. It will be also reduce the time taken to perform all these duties 
manually.
Our project aims at Service automation, i.e. we have tried to computerize various 
processes of real life HR Helpdesk. In computer system, it is not necessary to create the 
manifest but we can directly print it, which saves our time.
To assist the staff in capturing the effort spent on their respective working areas.To 
utilize resources in an efficient manner by increasing their productivity through 
automation.The system will have a good user interface and be expandable. It would be 
delivered on schedule within the budget.

# Project Design :
In this phase, a logical system is built which fulfils the given requirements. Design phase of
software development deals with transforming the clients’s requirements into a logically working
system. Normally, design is performed in the following in the following two steps:
1. Primary Design Phase:
In this phase, the system is designed at block level. The blocks are created on the basis of
analysis done in the problem identification phase. Different blocks are created for different
functions emphasis is put on minimizing the information flow between blocks.
Thus, all activities which require more interaction are kept in
one block.
2. Secondary Design Phase:
In the secondary phase the detailed design of every block is performed.
The general tasks involved in the design process are the following:
1. Design various blocks for overall system processes.
2. Design smaller, compact and workable modules in each block.
3. Design various database structures.
4. Specify details of programs to achieve desired functionality.
5. Design the form of inputs, and outputs of the system.
6. Perform documentation of the design.
7. System reviews.
User Interface Design:
User Interface Design is concerned with the dialogue between a user and the computer. It
is concerned with everything from starting the system or logging into the system to the eventually 
presentation of desired inputs and outputs. The overall flow of screens and messages is called a
dialogue.
