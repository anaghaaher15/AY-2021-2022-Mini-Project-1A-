ONLINE LAB DEADSTOCK MANAGEMENT
GROUP MEMBERS NAME :- adarsh singh , pooja sharma , nainisha sharma , aditya waingade.
DESCRIPTION ABOUT PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION :- our project is about management of lab's deadstock , for achieving this task we have created front end or UI on netbeans IDE and database or backend on dbderby . further we have linked our frontEnd and BackEnd through mySQL connector . firstly in back end we have database for our lab's deadstock by creating specific tables for specified pages in UI . then we have created our UI pages in front end in following order :- signup page , signin page , home page , particular lab pages for 5 labs . for project implementation first user needs to register him/herself in signup page and then signin through required credentials then he/she will be able to see the home page where all the labs are listed , to enter in any specified lab he/she needs to click on that particular lab button , after that he/she will be directed to specified lab page where user will be able to add , delete , modify , search , clear , the data records of listed items in that lab . the changes made by user in lab page will reflect in UI as well as that lab's created database table similarly any change made by user in database table will reflect in that lab's UI page in front end since both front and backends are linked together by mySQL connector . Thus user will be able to manage lab's deadstock list of items easily and efficiently .
