 DESCRIPTION: 
 With a custom regimen, your skin care routine will be able to tell you if the products you are using will interact negatively together. Instead of having to find out the hard way that using your toner and your acne treatment together is proving too harsh for your skin, you will be able to choose one or the other to use right away Start with mild products and, as your skin acclimates, move up to more aggressive products. If your skin is extremely oily, you may be able to start with the stronger products, especially if you have acne on the back or chest. It will provide the proper moisture balance and protection level for your skin. Proper skin protection prevents sun damage, which is the major factor in younger-looking skin. Not to mention that all the products you'll be using will be customized based on your skin's unique needs, which will keep your face looking fresh and beautiful. Most products in a custom regimen are made to keep skin clear and acne-free so that you can avoid breakouts and other skin problems. When you follow the regimen as you should, it can keep breakouts at bay and reveal the clearer, smoother skin that you have been looking for. Do not spot treat. Conditions such as acne are in different stages of formation and therefore, you need to treat the entire area. How many times have you tried a new product only to find out that it didn't work for your skin, caused breakouts or other problems, or was just simply unnecessary? With a custom regimen, you won't waste your money on products that you don't need or that won't benefit your skin over time. Contrary to popular belief that a custom regimen is more expensive, it may actually save you money because you will only buy what you really need.
